## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security hardening measures implemented for the Ansible-based credential rotation system to meet environment requirements under DISA STIG and Risk Management Framework (RMF) controls.

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### CRITICAL UPDATE: Zero Local Credential Storage

  enabled: true
  audit_failure_action: "syslog"
  max_log_size: 100MB
  num_logs: 10
  compliance_log_retention: 2555 days  # 7 years DISA STIG requirement
```

#### Monitored Events
- Password and shadow file modifications
- Privilege escalation events
- Authentication attempts
- System time changes
- Network connections
- File access patterns

#### Log Security
- **Encryption:** All logs encrypted at rest
- **Integrity:** Digital signatures for log tampering detection
- **Centralization:** Syslog integration for SIEM correlation
- **Retention:** 7-year retention for compliance requirements

### 6. Password Policy Enforcement

#### DISA STIG Compliance
```yaml
password_policy:
  min_length: 14
  max_password_age: 90 days
  min_password_age: 1 day
  password_history: 12
  complexity_requirements:
    - require_uppercase: true
    - require_lowercase: true
    - require_numbers: true
    - require_special_chars: true
    - deny_username_in_password: true
```

## Security Architecture: Zero Local Credential Storage Model

### Implementation Overview
- **No Password Hash Persistence:** Complete elimination of credential storage on target systems
- **Memory-Only Processing:** Credentials processed in Ansible controller memory only
- **Enhanced Validation:** Comprehensive pre-flight testing reduces failure probability
- **Manual Recovery:** Console access (IPMI/iLO) required for failed rotations

### Security Benefits
1. **Eliminated Attack Surface:**
   - No password hashes stored on managed systems
   - No credential files to compromise or extract
   - Zero forensic recovery risk from target systems

2. **Reduced Exposure Window:**
   - Credentials only in memory during execution
   - No persistent storage creating offline attack opportunities
   - Immediate cleanup after rotation completion

3. **Enhanced Compliance:**
   - Meets zero-trust security principles
   - Aligns with classified environment requirements
   - Supports defense-in-depth strategy

## Ansible Vault Security Limitations

### Current Implementation
- **Algorithm:** AES-256 (FIPS approved)
- **PBKDF2 Iterations:** 10,000 (hardcoded, not configurable)
- **Key Derivation:** SHA-256 based
- **Format:** Ansible Vault 1.1/1.2 standard

### Remaining Security Gaps
1. **Insufficient PBKDF2 Iterations:**
   - Current: 10,000 iterations
   - OWASP 2023 Recommendation: 600,000+ iterations
   - Impact: Reduced resistance to brute force attacks

2. **Non-configurable Security Parameters:**
   - Cannot increase iteration count without breaking compatibility
   - No support for alternative key derivation functions (scrypt, Argon2)

3. **FIPS Validation Status:**
   - Algorithm is FIPS-approved but module validation unclear
   - May require certified cryptographic module for secure environments

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Mitigations
1. **Zero Local Storage:** Eliminated password hash persistence on target systems (IMPLEMENTED)
2. **Enhanced Pre-flight Validation:** Comprehensive testing reduces failure rates (IMPLEMENTED)
3. **Strong Vault Passwords:** Minimum 256-bit entropy
4. **Secure Key Storage:** HSM integration recommended
5. **Network Segmentation:** Isolated Ansible control nodes
6. **Access Controls:** Multi-factor authentication required

### Long-term Recommendations
1. **HSM Integration:** Hardware Security Module for key storage
2. **Enterprise Secret Management:** Consider HashiCorp Vault or similar
3. **Certified Modules:** Deploy on FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ validated systems
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** SIEM integration for real-time threat detection
