## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security hardening measures implemented for the Ansible-based credential rotation system to meet environment requirements under DISA STIG and Risk Management Framework (RMF) controls.

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Ansible Configuration Hardening (`ansible.cfg`)

#### SSH Security Enhancements
- **Host Key Verification:** Enabled `host_key_checking = True` (was previously disabled)
- **FIPS-Compliant Ciphers:** Restricted to AES-256-GCM and AES-256-CTR
- **Strong MAC Algorithms:** Limited to HMAC-SHA2-256 and HMAC-SHA2-512
- **Secure Key Exchange:** Enforced DH-Group14-SHA256 and DH-Group16-SHA512
- **Host Key Algorithms:** Restricted to RSA-SHA2-512 and RSA-SHA2-256

#### Connection Security
- **Secure Control Path:** Moved from `/tmp` to `~/.ansible/cp/` with 700 permissions
- **Connection Timeouts:** Implemented multiple timeout layers for security
- **Server Keep-Alive:** Added connection monitoring to detect tampering
- **Transfer Security:** Enforced SCP for file transfers

#### Information Security
- **Display Controls:** Disabled skipped host display to prevent information disclosure
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added timestamp and user tracking for audit trails

### 2. Vault Password File Security

#### File Permissions
- **Primary Vault File:** `.vault_pass` secured with 600 permissions
- **Backup Vault File:** `.vault_pass.backup` with identical security
- **Ownership:** Restricted to executing user only

#### Access Controls
- **Directory Security:** Created secure control path with 700 permissions
- **Backup Strategy:** Implemented secure backup with integrity protection

### 3. FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Compliance

#### Approved Algorithms
```yaml
fips_compliance:
  enabled: true
  enforce_fips_mode: true
  approved_ciphers:
    - aes256-gcm@openssh.com
    - aes256-ctr
    - aes192-ctr  # Fallback only
    - aes128-ctr  # Fallback only
  approved_macs:
    - hmac-sha2-256
    - hmac-sha2-512
    - hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
    - hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
```

#### Key Management
- **Minimum Key Size:** 2048-bit RSA (4096-bit recommended)
- **Key Exchange:** NIST-approved elliptic curves and DH groups
- **Encryption:** AES-256 minimum for all symmetric operations

### 4. Enhanced Security Logging and Audit

#### Audit Configuration
```yaml
audit_settings:
  enabled: true
  audit_failure_action: "syslog"
  max_log_size: 100MB
  num_logs: 10
  compliance_log_retention: 2555 days  # 7 years DISA STIG requirement
```

#### Monitored Events
- Password and shadow file modifications
- Privilege escalation events
- Authentication attempts
- System time changes
- Network connections
- File access patterns

#### Log Security
- **Encryption:** All logs encrypted at rest
- **Integrity:** Digital signatures for log tampering detection
- **Centralization:** Syslog integration for SIEM correlation
- **Retention:** 7-year retention for compliance requirements

### 5. Password Policy Enforcement

#### DISA STIG Compliance
```yaml
password_policy:
  min_length: 14
  max_password_age: 90 days
  min_password_age: 1 day
  password_history: 12
  complexity_requirements:
    - require_uppercase: true
    - require_lowercase: true
    - require_numbers: true
    - require_special_chars: true
    - deny_username_in_password: true
```

## Ansible Vault Security Limitations

### Current Implementation
- **Algorithm:** AES-256 (FIPS approved)
- **PBKDF2 Iterations:** 10,000 (hardcoded, not configurable)
- **Key Derivation:** SHA-256 based
- **Format:** Ansible Vault 1.1/1.2 standard

### Security Gaps
1. **Insufficient PBKDF2 Iterations:**
   - Current: 10,000 iterations
   - OWASP 2023 Recommendation: 600,000+ iterations
   - Impact: Reduced resistance to brute force attacks

2. **Non-configurable Security Parameters:**
   - Cannot increase iteration count without breaking compatibility
   - No support for alternative key derivation functions (scrypt, Argon2)

3. **FIPS Validation Status:**
   - Algorithm is FIPS-approved but module validation unclear
   - May require certified cryptographic module for secure environments

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Mitigations
1. **Strong Vault Passwords:** Minimum 256-bit entropy
2. **Secure Key Storage:** HSM integration recommended
3. **Network Segmentation:** Isolated Ansible control nodes
4. **Access Controls:** Multi-factor authentication required

### Long-term Recommendations
1. **HSM Integration:** Hardware Security Module for key storage
2. **Enterprise Secret Management:** Consider HashiCorp Vault or similar
3. **Certified Modules:** Deploy on FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ validated systems
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** SIEM integration for real-time threat detection

## Compliance Verification

### DISA STIG Controls
- ✅ Strong cryptographic algorithms (AES-256)
- ✅ Secure authentication mechanisms
- ✅ Audit logging and monitoring
- ✅ Access control enforcement
- ⚠️ Key derivation strength (10,000 iterations)

### RMF Controls
- ✅ AC (Access Control) family compliance
- ✅ AU (Audit and Accountability) family compliance
- ✅ SC (System and Communications Protection) family compliance
- ✅ IA (Identification and Authentication) family compliance


## Operational Security Procedures

### Daily Operations
1. Monitor audit logs for anomalies
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Check system compliance status

### Weekly Operations
1. Review security log summaries
2. Validate vault password file integrity
3. Test backup restoration procedures

### Monthly Operations
1. Rotate vault passwords
2. Review and update security configurations
3. Conduct security assessment

### Quarterly Operations
1. Full security audit
2. Penetration testing
3. Compliance verification
4. Update security documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Vault Password Compromise
1. Immediately rotate all vault passwords
2. Re-encrypt all vault files with new passwords
3. Audit all recent access to vault files
4. Investigate source of compromise

### System Compromise
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve audit logs
3. Initiate incident response procedures
4. Restore from known-good backups
